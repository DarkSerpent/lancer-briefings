Born into slavery on Rust-7, a lawless Diasporan world resembling a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Biscuit Young learned survival through theft, deception, and calculated violence. After being sold to space pirates at fifteen, he endured brutal conditions in a sulfur mining penal colony until a tragic incident sparked a prison riot under his leadership. His tactical genius during the escape—including his first time piloting a mech—revealed natural combat abilities that would eventually lead him to Albion Company.

Now serving as one of Albion's Lancers, Biscuit maintains the same adaptive resilience and disarming optimism that kept him alive through years of exploitation. His combat style reflects his unconventional background—prioritizing improvisation and environmental advantage over formal tactics, often identifying solutions that trained military specialists overlook. Despite his lack of formal education, Biscuit demonstrates remarkable mechanical intuition and tactical awareness, turning the hard-won lessons of survival into effective battlefield approaches.

Behind his characteristic smile and casual demeanor lies a complex individual who forms genuine connections with his colleagues while maintaining the vigilance his past has taught him is necessary. Whether sharing video games with Iris, drinking with Korra, or playfully flirting with female team members, Biscuit creates bonds through shared experiences rather than shared histories. His personal philosophy—"Still breathing, aren't I? Everything else is negotiable"—encapsulates the resilience that transformed a former slave into a respected Lancer whose unconventional approach consistently achieves results when traditional methods fail.
