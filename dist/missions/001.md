# Mission // #001
## Destroy & Rescue: Helios Resource Operations
# Goals
- Defeat the Crimson Scythe pirate collective that have taken control of the Helios Resource Mining Outpost.
- Minimize structural damage.
- Ensure the safety of approximately 120 facility personnel being held hostage

# Description
At 0800 hours, a specialized Lancer unit will deploy via Albion dropship to Helios-12 (Antares-9 system) to neutralize a hostile takeover of the strategically significant Meridian Mining Complex by the Crimson Scythe pirate collective. The facility, which produces 18% of Union's titanium-vanadium alloy supply and specialized blink gate components, was seized 72 hours ago and is currently occupied by 35-40 combatants including five licensed Lancers. Intelligence indicates the hostiles, led by former HA contractor Eliza "Harvester" Voss, are utilizing the facility's fabrication capabilities to produce unauthorized blink gate architecture for an unidentified third party, with completion expected within 96 hours.

The operation encompasses three primary objectives: neutralize the Crimson Scythe presence while minimizing infrastructure damage, secure data regarding their blink gate modifications, and ensure the safety of approximately 120 facility personnel being held hostage. Complicating factors include potential weaponization of the atmospheric processing system, automated defenses under enemy control, and detected energy signatures consistent with experimental NHP architecture. The team will arrive at Helios-12 at 0000 local time, providing optimal conditions for nighttime insertion, and must execute with precision and restraint to prevent catastrophic system failures while securing the modified components for analysis.
