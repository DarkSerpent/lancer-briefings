Raton Kinglier's extraordinary journey began in the abandoned alleyways of Diador-5, where as an orphaned child he formed an unprecedented bond with the colony's unusually intelligent rats. What started as mutual survival evolved into genuine partnership, with Raton and his rat family developing a symbiotic relationship that allowed them to navigate the harsh realities of a forgotten Diasporan world through street performances and collaborative problem-solving.

His life changed dramatically when a modified fabricator produced not the cheese wheel he attempted to create, but components for an experimental HORUS mech designated "Rat King." This unique frame, designed for multi-consciousness piloting, allowed Raton and his rat companions to function as a collective neural network, each controlling specific subsystems while Raton managed primary navigation. This unprecedented capability brought him to Albion Company, where his distributed awareness and unconventional tactical approach offered capabilities beyond standard combat parameters.

Three months into his tenure with Albion, Raton continues adapting to human social dynamics after years of primarily non-human companionship. His intelligence and quick learning help bridge this gap, while his unique perspective provides innovative solutions to complex problems.
